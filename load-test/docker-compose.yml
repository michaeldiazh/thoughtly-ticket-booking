# Docker Compose Configuration for Load Testing
# 
# This file defines 3 services that work together:
# 1. mysql - The database (MySQL 8.4)
# 2. backend - Your Node.js backend service
# 3. k6 - The load testing tool
#
# Docker Compose automatically creates a network so services can talk to each other
# by using their service names as hostnames (e.g., "mysql" instead of "localhost")
